Makefile correctly set up:				2/2
Code well structured:					1/2
Code properly formatted and commented: 			2/4
Code works correctly for hex output: 			3/4
Code works correctly for decimal output: 		4/4
Code works correctly for formatted character output: 	0/4

The program dumps in hex and decimal, but the printCharacter function was not implemented.
In the functions that were implemented, the commenting is good; the indentation could be improved.
Note that `*data' is not a pointer. `data' is the pointer, `*data' is the value that the pointer
`data' points to.

- please indent code consistently (one indentation per block)
- line 19: replace *data++ with data++
- please avoid long lines in the README
- hex output field size not constant (use the specifier %02x instead)
