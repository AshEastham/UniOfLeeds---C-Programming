To run the program simply open a terminal window and navigate to the directory
where the file has been downloaded.  You can do this by using the cd command.

cd <folder path>

Once you've navigated to the desired folder simply enter:

./textbanners

The program will open, to use the program, simply input some text and press enter.  
The text will now appear in a banner form, blown up using asterisks.  If you would
like to enter more text, simply press the up arrow whilst in the terminal to bring
up the "./textbanners" command again and press enter, this will re-execute the program and
you'll be able to enter more text.
