- The cost is computed correctly, on reasonable assumptions
- Constants and variables are used appropriately (most of the time! - see below)
- Inflation is handled correctly
- The monthly totals and variable values are printed
- The code is formatted and commented

Ash,

This is a pretty nice assignment.
Formatting of the output and code is excellent, and the calculation is correct.
Please note the points below.
Well done.

- The inflation rate should be declared as a constant. The lines

      const float inflationRate = 1.01;
      ...
      itemCost *= inflationRate;

  are much better than

    itemCost *= 1.01;

- When initialising a float, use a float literal with a trailing `f',
  as in float myFloat = 400.0f; 

- You did not declare a type for TuitionFees; you should write this:

    const int TuitionFees = 900;

  Luckily for you, gcc defaults to type int, so you got away with this one.
